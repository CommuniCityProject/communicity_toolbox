The context broker is a component that manages, stores and processes real-time data coming from different sensors, devices, and systems, organizing it in a standardized format. Here, the context broker acts as a mediator between the APIs and the data sources. It offers an efficient way of retrieving and publishing data, using a well-known standard and unifying the output of each Toolbox component in a single common endpoint.
