This API aims to perform instance segmentation in images. It predicts the position and a segmentation mask of 80 different general objects like cars, people, or animals. It generates entities following the "InstanceSegmentation" data model (one for each object) that are posted to the context broker and returned as JSON. The input of the API is the ID of an image present in the context broker.
