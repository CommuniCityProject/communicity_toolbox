This API aims to perform face recognition. It generates entities following the "Face" data model (one for each face) that are posted to the context broker and returned as a JSON. It can detect faces in images, extract their features and recognize them using a previously created dataset. The features extraction and the recognition phase can be performed in one step or on separate steps. The input of the API is the ID of an Image or a "Face" entity present in the context broker. If an Image is provided, the model will detect all the faces in the image and will extract and (optionally) recognize them. If a "Face" entity is provided with the features stored in it, the API can use them to recognize the face. If the "Face" entity has no features, the coordinates of the face will be used to extract the features and optionally recognize them. The output will be added to the original "Face" entity and updated on the context broker.
