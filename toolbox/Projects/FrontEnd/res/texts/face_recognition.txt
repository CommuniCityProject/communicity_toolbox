This API aims to perform face recognition. It generates entities following the "Face" data model (one for each face) that are posted to the context broker and returned as JSON. It can detect faces in images, extract their features, and recognize them using a previously created dataset. The feature extraction and recognition phases can be performed in one step or separately. The input of the API is the ID of an "Image" or "Face" entity present in the context broker. If an image is provided, the model will detect all the faces in the image and recognize them. If a "Face" entity is provided with features in it, the API can use them to recognize the face. If the "Face" entity has no features, the face coordinates will be used to extract the features and optionally recognize them. The output will be added to the original "Face" entity and updated in the context broker.
