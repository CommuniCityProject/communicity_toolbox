This API serves as a common storage for images, that can be used to temporally store the input and output images of other Toolbox APIs. For each uploaded image, an entity is created on the context broker following the "Image" data model, which enables other applications to know about its existence, access them and create references. This API also includes a method to visualize the content of the Toolbox Data Models. It receives as input the ID of one or more entities present in the context broker, as well as optional visualization parameters (like colors, text size, etc.) and generates an image with the data of the entities visualized over the source image.
