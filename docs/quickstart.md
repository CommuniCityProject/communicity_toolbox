<!-- 1. An image is uploaded to the ImageStorage service and its id is returned. Alternatively, an _Image_ entity with an URL to an image can be created manually in the Context Broker.
2. The API of a Project is called using the ID of the previously created image. The project will process the image and it will return a list of entities with the results. We can also find the entities created on the Context Broker with the id of the returned entities.
3. If we want to visualize the created entities we can use the ImageStorage service to create an image with their data drawn over the source image. It will return an id that can be used to retrieve the image from the ImageStorage service. -->
