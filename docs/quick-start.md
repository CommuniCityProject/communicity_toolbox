# Quick-Start

The Toolbox can be used in three different ways:
- As a web page, using the provided front-end that allows any user to quickly try the main functionalities.
- As a set of APIs that can be deployed with Docker composes.
- As a Python library.

To start using the APIs and the front end, refer to the [Docker guide](./docker.md) and set up the provided Docker compose.

If you want to use the Toolbox as a Python library to build your apps or to expand the Toolbox, [install it using pip](./installation.md) or use a Docker container. You can also refer to the [Python Notebooks](https://github.com/CommuniCityProject/communicity_toolbox/tree/master/docs/Notebooks) to see some basic examples of how to use the Toolbox.
