This API aims to detect people in images and predict their poses. It generates up to 17 body key points that encode the position of different body parts like elbows, shoulders, or eyes. It generates entities following the "PersonKeyPoints" data model (one for each person) that are posted to the context broker and returned as JSON. The input of the API is the ID of an image.
