This API serves as a common storage for images that can be used to temporarily store input and output images of other Toolbox APIs. For each uploaded image, an entity is created in the context broker following the "Image" data model, which enables other applications to know about its existence, access it, and create references. This API also includes a method to visualize the Toolbox data models content. It receives as input the ID of one or more entities present in the context broker, as well as optional parameters (like colors, text size, etc.), and generates an image with the data of the entities visualized on the source image.
